# CNC_INSEE_project

*Data management project.*

<br>

We try in this project to answer the following question : **"How has the movie theaters landscape evolved over the last 50 years in France, and what role do sociodemographic factors play in these changes?"**

<br>

In order to do taht we combine two databases :

-   CNC's "**Exploitation - data by department**" : <https://www.cnc.fr/cinema/etudes-et-rapports/exploitation--donnees-par-departement_223440>

-   INSEE's "***Harmonized population census data from 1968***" : <https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/6671801?sommaire=2414232> 
<br>

2 quarto documents composed the project :

-   **1_Code_project** contains the main codes of the data treatment

-   **2_Parallel_code_Insee** contains is a complementary qmd containing the codes that were used to simplify the Insee's database. They were put aside on a distinct document because of the significant size of the treated data
