## Sources

This project is powered by two databases :

-   CNC's "**Exploitation - data by department**" : <https://www.cnc.fr/cinema/etudes-et-rapports/exploitation--donnees-par-departement_223440>

-   INSEE's "***Harmonized population census data from 1968***" : <https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/6671801?sommaire=2414232>

<br>

### "***Exploitation - data by department***"

*Original french name : "**Exploitation - données par département**"*

The first database was created by the French National Center for Cinema and the Moving Image, most commonly known as CNC. The CNC is an agency of the French Ministry of Culture. Its role is to implement the state's policy on the question of cinema, audiovisual and multimedia. It is notably in charge of the regulation, promotion and distribution of French movies.

In the execution of its mission, the French agency also collects data regarding its purview and proposes part of them in open access. The database "Exploitation - data by department" is one of the aforementioned open data. It is a statistical monitoring of the evolution of French cinema theaters and their attendance between 1966 and 2022. Notably, it contains data on the number of venues, their characteristics (e.g. number of screens, seating capacity, ...); but also on the number of sold tickets and gained revenues. As its name indicates, French departments (according to their 2021 administrative division) are the statistical unit of the data. The CNC's data is constructed by using two primary sources :

-   the **list of cinemas** authorized by the agency

-   and their "bordereaux des recettes" which can be roughly translated by "**revenue slips**"

<br>

### "***Harmonized population census data from 1968***"

*Original title : Données harmonisées des recensements de la population à partir de 1968*

The second database was produced by Insee, the french National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. Insee is French national bureau and one of its major data providers. The data that will be used for this project has for source demographic information which comes from the different population censuses between 1968 and 2019.

```{r Summary_of_the_last_census, message = FALSE}
list_of_census <- data.frame(census = paste0("n°", 1:8),year=c(1968,1975,1982,1990,1999,2008,2013,2019))

list_of_census<- list_of_census |>  pivot_wider(names_from="census",values_from = "year")

list_of_census |> knitr::kable(caption ="French census between 1968 and 2019", format="html", align='c')
```

Censuses are one of the most important data collections taking place in France. Answering their survey is an obligation for all inhabitants under penalty of a fine (article 3 of the Law n°51-711 of 7 June 1951). Historically, population censuses took the form of an exhaustive collect of all French townships during a same year. However, the collection method evolved in 2002. Nowadays, Insee uses a rotational approach. For townships of at least 10 000 inhabitants, 8% of the housing of are interviewed each year. The goal is then to cover 40% of their population over a 5-year period. This 5-year moving sample is then used to estimate demographic data annually. For townships with less than 10 000 inhabitants, the collection is still exhaustive but is not simultaneous. Indeed, it occurs in a fifth of towns each year ensuring that all townships are censused every 5 years. Demographic information between 2 collections is then estimated using data from the nearest one.

The data is collected by face-to-face interviews or-since 2015- via internet surveys.

The database that will be used in this project is an harmonized compilation of data from 8 census databases. Its content includes the number of inhabitants by department and key socio-demographic variables (e.g. age, socio-professional categories, type of professional activity).

It can be downloaded from the [INSEE website](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/6671801?sommaire=2414232) in a DBF or CSV format.

## Modification of the original databases

### Formatting and cleaning the Insee database

The two databases underwent transformations to become exploitable for our project. The main problem of the Insee one is that it consumes a lot of RAM because of its size (3GB). Indeed, some categorical variables have a significant number of "categories"/"levels". For example, the variable on the age of the population contains 120 levels, one by each possible year of life of an individual. As a result, the number of potential combinations, and therefore the number of rows, among all variables is impressively large, contributing to the important size of the database.

```{r Calculation_of_the_number_of_rows_in_Insee_cleanv3 , message = FALSE}

insee_data <- read.csv("Data/INSEE_cleanv3.csv")

insee_data <- insee_data |> select(-X) #we drop X, the column which is an index of each row

insee_data <- insee_data |> filter(nchar(DEP_RES_21) != 3) #We drop oversea department

insee_data <- insee_data |> rename(departement_code = DEP_RES_21, year =  AN_RECENS)

insee_data_clean <- insee_data |> filter(!is.na(AGE_GROUP))

In_nrow <- insee_data_clean |> nrow()
```

Our task was to reduce the number of these combinations in order to downsize the database. To do so, we transform the 120 levels of the variable corresponding to the age into 5 age ranges. Furthermore, we get rid of the variables that were not useful to our project using a group_by function. This allows us to go from a database of more than 50 millions rows to a CSV with `r In_nrow` rows.

The process that we used is detailed in the quarto document entitled "Parallel_code_Insee" that is available in this R project. We have preferred to put it in a separate QMD because of the size of the database linked with its code.

<br>

### Formatting and cleaning of the CNC database

The CNC's data was less memory-consuming. However, its format was not convenient for coding with R. Indeed, the original XSLX document put each variable in an independent sheet. In the codes below, we merge all this independent sheets into one uniform database.

```{r Cleaning_formating_function, message = FALSE}
file_path <- "Data/exploitation_données_par_département.xlsx"

# Function to read and process a sheet
read_and_process_sheet <- function(sheet_index) {
  cnc_data <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = sheet_index, skip = 5) |>
    select(-2) |>
    rename(departement_code = 1) |>
    pivot_longer(cols = -departement_code, 
                 names_to = "year", 
                 values_to = excel_sheets(file_path)[sheet_index])
  
  return(cnc_data)
}
```

```{r Cleaning_CNC_database, message = FALSE}

cnc_data_merge <- read_and_process_sheet(4)

for (i in seq(from = 5, to = which(excel_sheets(file_path) == "tmofAE"))) {
  cnc_data_merge <- left_join(cnc_data_merge, read_and_process_sheet(i),
                              by = c("departement_code", "year"))
}
```

As mentioned above, the original XSLX file has multiple sheets. Each sheet is equivalent to a variable and has :

-   rows as departements

-   and columns as years.

To facilitate the merger of each sheets, the initial step was to rename the first column so that we make sure that each sheet shares the same name. This task was performed by the codes above. Then, the second column which is the department was dropped. It permit us to start the merger.

```{r Suppression_of_total_rows, message = FALSE}
cnc_data_clean <- cnc_data_merge |>
  filter(!is.na(departement_code))
```

Additionally, each sheet includes a row which represents the total. We preferred to exclude it in order to simplify next statistical treatment.

```{r replace_NA_by_0_multiplexes, message = FALSE}
multiplexes_with_0 <- cnc_data_clean |> 
  select(multiplexes, year, departement_code) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = multiplexes) |> 
  mutate(across(where(~any(!is.na(.))), ~ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = -departement_code, names_to = "year", values_to = "multiplexes")

cnc_data_clean <- cnc_data_clean |> select(-multiplexes) 
  
cnc_data_clean <- left_join(cnc_data_clean, multiplexes_with_0, by = c("departement_code", "year"))
```

In the original "Multiplexes" sheet, NA value were assigned when there were 0 multiplexes. We replaced this NA value with 0. and ensured that this replacement only occurs for the year when data had been collected.

```{r Dropped_redundant_variables}
rme <- cnc_data_clean |> select(departement_code, year, RME)
rmeAE <- cnc_data_clean |> select(departement_code, year, RMEAE)
tmof <- cnc_data_clean |> select(departement_code, year, `taux d'occupation des fauteuils`)
tmofAE <- cnc_data_clean |> select(departement_code, year, tmofAE)

cnc_data_clean <- cnc_data_clean |> select(-`indice de fréquentation`, 
                                           -`indice de fréquentationAE`, 
                                           -RME, 
                                           -RMEAE,
                                           -`taux d'occupation des fauteuils`,
                                           -tmofAE)
```

We exclude redundant variables from the final, cleaned database and retain them in separate variables. This ensures that the excluded variables are preserved for future reference, eliminating the need to recalculate them later on.

<br>

## Description of the final bases before merging

The final result is two modified datasets.

**cnc_data_clean**

```{r size_CNC}
cnc_data_clean %>%
  summarize(
      "Number of rows" = prettyNum(nrow(.), big.mark = " "),  
      "Number of columns" = ncol(.)
      ) %>%
  
  knitr::kable(caption = "Description of the CNC database", 
               format = "html", 
               align = 'c')
```

```{r summary_CNC}
cnc_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(
    across(where(is.numeric),list(
      Mean = ~prettyNum(mean(., na.rm = TRUE), big.mark = " "),
      Median = ~prettyNum(median(., na.rm = TRUE), big.mark = " ")
    ))
    ) %>% 
  t() %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Statistics of the CNC's variables", format = "html", align = 'c')
```

**insee_data (from Insee_cleanv3.csv)**

```{r Nb_rows_and_columns_Insee}
insee_data_clean %>%
  summarize(
    "Number of rows" = prettyNum(nrow(.), big.mark = " "),
    "Number of columns" = ncol(.)
    )%>%
  
 knitr::kable(caption = "Description of the Insee database", format = "html", align='c')
```

```{r summary_INSEE}
insee_data_clean %>%
  select(-POND2) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(),n_distinct)) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Number of unique values/levels by characteristics variable", format = "html", align = 'c')
```

<br>

### Description of the variables

We have in the CNC database different variables :

-   "**établissement**" represents the **number of movie theaters** for each department
-   "**écrans**" represents the **number of screens,** i.e. movie rooms for each department
-   "**fauteuils**" represents the total **number of seats** in all movie theaters for each department
-   "**multiplexes**" represents the **number of** **multiplexes** for each department . A multiplex is a movie theater complex with multiple screens within a single complex.
-   "**séances**" represents the total **number of seances [in thousand]{.underline}** for each department
-   "**entrées**" represents the total **number of tickets bought [in million]{.underline}** for each department
-   "**recettes**" represents the **total** **revenue in million** for each department
-   "**RME**" represents the **average revenue by bought tickets**
-   "**Taux d'occupation des fauteuils**" is the ratio between **entries during the year and the product between the number of seats and the number of sessions**. Taux d'occupation des fauteuils makes it possible to assess the [**"fullness" of the rooms.**]{.underline}

And we have the same for Arthouse. the term Arthouse refers to so-called auteur films, economically independent, with small budgets, open to the different cultures of the world. An Arthouse cinema is a cinematographic establishment which exhibits a significant proportion of recommended Arthouse films and which supports these often difficult films with an adapted animation policy.

Insee database is a sociodemographic description of each department with variables such as :

-   "**DEP_RES_21**" represents the **department of residence where individuals live**
-   "**AGE_GROUP**" is our computed data representing the **age of the population by range of 15 years**.
-   "**TYP_ACT**" give us the **type of activity** .
-   "**CSP**" is a categorial data that has for levels **socio-professional category**
-   "**POND2**" gives us **the number of** **inhabitants** a**ccording the combination of all previous variables**

<br>

## Merging the INSEE and CNC database

```{r merging}
cnc_data_clean$year <- as.integer(cnc_data_clean$year) 

data_merge <- left_join(cnc_data_clean, insee_data, by = c("departement_code", "year"))

data_clean <- data_merge |>
  filter(!is.na(POND2))
```

<br>

## Research question

A central question will guide our research : **"How has the movie theater landscape in France evolved over the past five decades, and what role have sociodemographic factors played in shaping these transformations?"**

The databases at our disposal will help us to explore this question by looking into the following key aspects:

1.  **Evolution of the Market :** The information provided will help us understand how the movie theater market has evolved in terms of volumes over the last fifty years. One of the key aspects in exploring this question will be to examine the market evolution in terms of venues (établissements). However, the number of movie theaters will not be our sole indicator. Indeed, the number of sessions (séances), seats (fauteuils), and screens (écrans) will be complementary variables that can help us to put under the spotlight potential trends that may not be apparent when solely examining the number of venues. Employing panel data has a dual utility here. It not only enables us to capture the overall temporal trends but also to observe potential cross-sectional differences. Indeed, one of our key objectives is to comprehend whether divergences in trajectories and characteristics exist among the various French departments.

2.  **Structural Shifts with Multiplexes:** A zoom on the multiplexes permits evaluating a recent structural transformation in the movie theater industry. The first one appears in France during the end of the 1990s and can be arguably seen as a shift in the cinema market. Blanchard ([2014](https://www.cairn.info/revue-migrations-societe-2014-1-page-153.htm)) argues that these facilities "have contributed to the resurgence of attendance, notably by making the cinema more accessible to suburban residents." Furthermore, despite their relative novelty, they represent an important share of the market industry.

3.  **Economic Health of the Industry:** Variables such as the number of tickets bought (entrées) and total revenue (recettes) will also be complementary and potentially important information. They will notably be key tools for gauging the economic vitality of the industry and determining if the economic dynamics align with the stock of venues, seats, and their past investments.

4.  **Cultural Diversity through Arthouse Cinemas:** The representation of Arthouse cinemas in our dataset highlights the emergence of a cultural niche. Examining the growth and audience engagement of these cinemas provides insights into the supply and demand for culturally diverse content.

5.  **Demographic Dynamics :** The inclusion of variables from the INSEE database is a key step in our investigation. Utilizing information on age groups (AGE_GROUP) and socio-professional categories (CSP) will enable us to discern whether correlations exist between the demographic composition of the population and the trajectories of distinct departmental markets.

In essence, our research delves into the recent history of movie theaters in France in order to explore the connection between their evolution and sociodemographic factors, while taking into account departmental heterogeneity.

# Evolution of the cinema market in time : a description of the major trend

## Introduction : the "golden age" of the first half of the 20th century

The history of the movie theater market unfolds on a winter day. In December 28th 1895, two brothers August and Louis Lumiere gave the first commercial public screening. Because a good history is full of happy coincidences, it is in France, at the Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris that the two brothers used their *cinématographe*.

![](Pictures%20and%20illustrations/cinema-lumiere.jpg){fig-align="center"}

The movie theaters market experienced fast growth. According to Muhlberger (2013), in 1920s, cinema became a mass leisure activity in France but also in the USA and numerous European countries. In the Hexagon, cinema market fully blossomed a decade later. The period between 1929 and 1957 is often described as a golden age for cinema in France. Movie theaters attendance reached its zenith, with peaks beyond 400 millions entries. In a report for the French Senate, Thiolliere and Ralite (2003) link this fast period with the introduction of talking films.

<br>

The importance of cinema during this period maybe undestimated by our contemporary eyes. However, the two senatorial rapporteur explain that :

"We forget too often \[...\] that until the advent of the 'petite lucarne' (i.e. television) in households, cinema had a monopoly on the broadcasting of images. People frequented the theater, not to see a film, but rather to watch a program consisting of one or more short films, news, the trailer for the next film and, after the intermission and advertising, of the 'feature film'."

<center>*THIOLLIERE Michel & RALITE Jack au nom de la Commission des affaires culturelles du Sénat, 2003.* L'évolution du secteur de l'exploitation cinématographique, Rapport d'information sénatoriale n°308 (2002-2003)</center>

<br>

Nevertheless, as in many stories, the golden age is not eternal. Ours knew its dawn in 1957. Attendance collapsed. It more than halved between 1957 and 1966. The arrival of television is often cited as not the sole but a pivotal factor in this decline, which we will see will continue during most of the 20th century.

#### Evolution of the attendance and revenue

```{r Aggregate_of_attendance_by_year}

```

```{r}

    filter(!is.na(Growth)) %>%
    pull(Growth) %>%
    round(digits = 2)

  return(growth_rate)
}

Growth_rate_1966_1992 <- calculate_growth_rate(Attendance_nat, 1966, 1992)
Growth_rate_1982_1992 <- calculate_growth_rate(Attendance_nat, 1982, 1992)
Growth_rate_1966_1969 <- calculate_growth_rate(Attendance_nat, 1966, 1969)

#Calculation of the average growth rate between 1966 and 1992

  Attendance_nat %>%

  filter(!is.na(Growth)) %>% 
  pull(Growth) %>%
  round(., digits=1)
```

Our analytic journey starts in 1966, which is the first availabe year in our used database. The CNC's data shows that trend that was observed between 1957 and 1966 continued over the next 26 years. Indeed, between 1966 and 1992, attendance was halved (`r Growth_rate_1966_1992` % with an average growth rate of `r Av_Growth_rate_1966_1992` % during the period). The movie theater market experienced especially two periods of sharp decline. Firstly, from1966 to 1969 attendance droped by `r abs(Growth_rate_1966_1969)` %. During this period, movie theaters witnessed 234 millions of entries in 1966 but only 183 millions in 1969. Similarly, in the decade spanning from1982 and 1992, attendance fell from 201 million to 115 million felt, representing a `r abs(Growth_rate_1982_1992)` % decrease.

```{r}
#Graphic of the evolution of attendance in time

```

<br>

18 of the 26 years between 1966 (not included) and 1992 (included) are thus characterized by a negative attendance's growth rate.The causes of this degrowth are multifactorial. The democratisation of television and of automobile are however presented as one of the the key factors of this decay.

Despite a decrease in attendance, we have from 1966 to 1982 increasing revenue - if we look at actualized revenue - due to increasing an increasing of the price of the ticket as we can see with the average revenue by ticket sold.

#### Evolution of the structure of the market

The number of seats strongly declined during this period. As we can see on the graphic below, while the Hexagon welcomed 2,4 million of cinema seats in 1966, only 93 000 seats characetrized the French market in 1992.

```{r statistics_on_seats_and_screens}
Equip_nat <- cnc_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(Screens = sum(écrans, na.rm = TRUE),
            Seats = sum(fauteuils, na.rm=TRUE),
            Seats_by_screens = Seats/Screens)
```

Data on the number of cinemas is not available on our database before 1992. However, we have for hypothesis that a part of this decline is due to the foreclosure of movie theaters. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is not sufficient to understand the evolution of the number of seats during this quarter of century.

Indeed, what can be surprising is that, at the same time that the number of seats diminished, the number of screens had a different journey.

Until 1971, the number of seats and screens followed the same downward trajectory. However, while the number of seats plundered, the number of screens tended to stabilize then to grow between 1972 and 1985. The graphic below highlights these elements. By using a 1966 base index 100 for both variables, we can focus on their evolution, putting aside the scale effect. The index of the number of seats almost halved from 1972 to 1985. In parallel the index of the number of screens is more than 20 points higher in 1985 than what was observed in 1972. It is even 5 points higher than the index in 1966. Despite the fact that the number of screens experienced a period of degrowth between 1986 and 1992, a serious gap exists between the two indexes in 1992.

```{r}
#Addition of base index 100 variable
Equip_nat <- Equip_nat %>%  mutate(Screens_b100=Screens/Screens[year==1966]*100, Seats_b100=Seats/Seats[year==1966]*100)


#Comparaison the number of seats and screens

   select(year,Screens_b100,Seats_b100) %>%

How can we comprehend these contradictory trends? Thiolliere and Ralite (2003) explained that this paradox can be explained by a structural change of the movie theater market. Prior to the late 60s, a large portion of the cinema market was dominated by single-screen movie halls with a substantial number of seats. Everything changed after the 60s. The second half of the 21st century witnessed a shift from one-room movie halls to halls with fewer seats but a plural number of screens. Thus, some former one-room cinemas repurposed their spaces to welcome more screens, and multiroom setups became predominant among newly constructed cinemas. Thiolliere and Ralite assert that this new structure enabled the industry to intensify its exploitation capabilities in order to offer more choices for its consumers. These new cinemas had better performance than their one-room elders, explaining the latter's gradual disappearance. This shift can be observed in the ratio of chairs to screens, which can be interpreted as an indicator of the size of the screening room in terms of seats.

In many movies, after a tragic downfall, the hero comeback in a flamboyant manner.If this storyline mark movies in theater, it also echoes the history of the industry. The 25 years between 1993 and 2019 are a period of growth for the cinema's market. The attendance went from 130 million to suprass the symbolic bar of the 200 million. If this level is still lower thanwhat was observed during the "golden age", the upturn is still significant with agrowth of `r Growth_rate_1993_2019` % during the period and an average growth of `r Av_Growth_rate_1993_2019` % by year.

Numerous scientific papers and reports agree that this revival is due to the development of multiplexes (Blanchard, 2014 ; CNC, 2013; Muhlberger, 2013; Thiolliere and Ralite, 2003). Theses structures would have sparked again the interest of the consumers for movie theaters.

#### Evolution of the structure of the market

Several concurrent definitions exist for the term 'multiplex.' A broad one can characterize multiplexes as movie halls with a large number of screens. Nevertheless, Blanchard (2014) argues that multiplexes cannot be solely summarized by the number of screens. He highlights that multiplexes also offer a better quality of the consumers' experience, with enhanced overall comfort in the screening room and access to additional services such as arcades or restaurants. According to this definition, the first multiplex opened in France in Toulon in 1993. The CNC (National Center of Cinematography and the Moving Image) uses a simpler definition to establish its statistics. It describes multiplexes as movie theaters with at least 8 screens - with this definition, 31 movie theaters met the multiplex criteria in 1992. Despite these differing definitions, both the CNC and Blanchard draw the same conclusion about the significant impact of multiplexes on the market upturn.

The last three decades are indeed an era of sustained growth for multiplexes. Their numbers have multiplied by seven between 1993 and 2022.

```{r Statistics_on_etablissement}
Etablissement_nat <- cnc_data_clean %>% 
  filter(!is.na(multiplexes)) %>%

    nb_etablissement = sum(établissements, na.rm = TRUE),

            )

Data on the number of cinemas were not available in the database prior to 1992. The existing data seem to reveal 3 phases :

-   a period of growth in the 90s

-   a decline in the number of cinemas between 2000 and 2014

-   and, a small revival between 2014 and 2018.

However, when observing the number of cinemas, multiplexes excluded, a different story unfolds before our eyes. The graph below shows the evolution of the number of cinemas, both with and without multiplexes. It appears that multiplexes accounted for most of the growth in the 1990s. Moreover, the number of cinemas has plummeted since 2000 when multiplexes are excluded from the count. Nevertheless, it is important to note that our analysis is limited by an element whose significance remains uncertain. Our data do not allow us to distinguish between the outright closure of cinemas and the transformation of former multiroom cinemas into multiplexes.

```{r}
Et_graph <- Etablissement_nat %>% 
  rename ("All movie theater"=nb_etablissement, "Movie theater excluding multiplexes" = nb_etablissements_no_m) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`All movie theater`, `Movie theater excluding multiplexes`),names_to = "Variables",values_to = "Nb") %>% 
  filter(year<2022) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=Nb, color=Variables)) +
  labs(title = "Number of movie theater in France between 1992 and 2022", x="Year", y="Number of cinemas")+
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.75)+
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


ggplotly(Et_graph, dynamicTicks = TRUE, tooltip = "text") %>%
  layout(legend = list(x = 0.1, y = -0.2, orientation = "h"))
  
#The rename function is used to change (only for the creation of this graphic) the name of the original column which became the values of the column"Variables". The goal behind this transformation is to have more significative name for the two curves in our legend. We also use the layout function to put the legend above the graph because plotly does not take into account theme(legend.position = "top") when it transform the ggplot.
```

The share of multiplexes in the total number of movie theaters also grew during this year, gaining 9.5 percentage points between 1993 and 2018. Furthermore, if multiplexes may still be a minority in the overall number of cinemas, this is not the case for the total number of attendance. They accounted for more than half of the entries in 2012 (Blanchard, 2014).

```{r}
M_graph2 <- Etablissement_nat %>% 
  filter(year >1992) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = share_multiplexe)) +

```

The number of seats started also to grow again. This growth did not compensante the historical significant decline that marked the second haft of the 20th century - c.f. graph below on the 1962-2022 period. However, it is still highlysignificant regarding the level observed in 1993 -c.f. graph below on the 1993-2022 period.

Classement des établissements " Art et Essai " Le classement Art et Essai des lieux de projection cinématographiques a fait l'objet d'une réforme qui s'applique depuis 2002. Le classement Art et Essai d'un lieu de projection cinématographique repose désormais : - sur un indice automatique indiquant la proportion de séances réalisées avec des films recommandés Art et Essai par rapport au total des séances offertes ; - sur une pondération de cet indice automatique par deux coefficients. D'une part, un coefficient majorateur qui apprécie le nombre de films proposés, la politique d'animation, l'environnement sociologique et l'environnement cinématographique, d'autre part un coefficient minorateur qui prend en compte l'état de l'établissement, la diversité des films Art et Essai proposés, l'insuffisance de fonctionnement (nombre de semaines et de séances hors période de travaux). Le classement se fait désormais par établissement et la référence géographique est l'unité urbaine dans laquelle est situé l'établissement. Le classement est effectué par la Directrice générale du CNC, après avis de la commission du cinéma d'Art et Essai, qui examine les dossiers de demande de classement des établissements pour une année au début de cette même année. Le montant des subventions est fixé en fonction de l'indice résultant des calculs exposés ci-dessus.

## Potential final procedure

The relationship between the sociodemographic characteristics of departments and the evolution of movie theaters' attendance can be tricky to analyze through the unique use of graphics. On one hand, because the variables in the dataset can be affected by complex interactions, relying solely on graphics can lead to spurious conclusions. On the other hand, graphics also have strong limitations when the number of variables of interest increases. That’s why econometric models can be useful to delve into a thorough analysis of the link between variables. This section is dedicated to employing econometric methodologies to find answers that address our research question. Specifically, we will attempt to understand which sociodemographic characteristics had a positive or negative influence on the heterogeneous evolution of attendance in French departments. To do so, we will employ a panel data econometric model that utilizes both the cross-sectional and longitudinal characteristics of our dataset.

\<br\>

However, we quickly realized that this project was ambitious. At this stage of our academic journey, our technical knowledge of econometrics is not sufficient to perform a solid panel regression that would address all the needs of our dataset. The use of panel data is beyond our current training and knowledge and such issue such as how to correct serial correlation in panel data, to deal with potential non-linearity or the use of dynamic models for example woul have been challenging. Nevertheless, we used this assignment as a training ground to familiarize ourselves with the procedures for performing an econometrics analysis on panel data.

\<br\>

After looking into various sources, our final procedure drew inspiration from Altaf (2017) and a document by Torres-Reyna (2010) for Princeton University. The codes and the process were also influenced by Schmidheiny (2023) and Wagle (2021). Bourbonnais (2020) also played a role in our understanding part of the theory behind the use of panel data.

\<br\>

This section is divided into three parts:

1.  The first part is dedicated to the tests and corrections that we used for our model,

2.  The second part discusses the obtained outcomes,

3.  We conclude by emphasizing some limitations that our approach encounters.

#### Choice of the type of model

We only employed basics techniques for econometric analysis of panel data. Three simple and standards models are often used for panel data :

1.  Regular OLS

2.  Fixed effect model

3.  Random effect model

An early step consists to analyze which technique best fits the dataset. The F Test for Individual and/or Time Effects of the **plm** package (**pFtest**) enable us to arbitrate between the use of a fixed effect model and an OLS. The decision criterion is that if the p-value is below the significance level of 0.05, the fixed effect model is preferred. Here, our F test p-value is under the aforementioned level.

```{r Test_between_fixed_effect_and_OLS}

#OLS Model
ols_2 <- plm(entrées ~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina, data=Econ_data_v2, index=c("departement_code", "year"), model="pooling")

#Fixed effect model
f_eff_2 <-plm(entrées ~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina, data=Econ_data_v2, index=c("departement_code", "year"), model="within")

# F Test for Individual and/or Time Effects test
pFtest(f_eff_2, ols_2)
```

The Hassman test continue our analysis by discerning the most suitable model between the fixed-effect and the random model. The p-value being below the significance level of 0.05, the fixed effect model is favored.

```{r Test_between_fixed_and_random_effect}
#Random effect model
r_eff_2 <-plm(entrées ~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina, data=Econ_data_v2, index=c("departement_code", "year"), model="random") 


#Haussman test to determine between fixed and random effect
phtest(f_eff_2, r_eff_2)

```

#### Test for time-fixed effect and individual effect

Having selected the fixed effect model, the next step was to identify if the addition of individual or time-fixed effects improve the model's quality.

We applied TORRES-REYNA (2010)'s method, which consist on adding dummy variables to craft models with these effect. On R, an alternative method exists. It consists of using the **effect** argument of the **plm** package with code such as ' **effect ="time"** 'or **effect = "individual"** '(Wagle, 2021; Croissant et al., 2023; Hanck et al., 2023). However, we had to abandon its usage betcause it gave us results that seems incoherent. Indeed, they provided us coefficient that seems excessively large.

With a p value below 0.05, the Brehsch-Pagan test support the hypothesis of using time-fixed effect. However, the Honda test rejects it. Despite different coefficients, we decided to use time–fixed effects. Indeed, while testing the function with and without the **effect** argument, we remarked that despite having different coefficient, the two techniques found the same significant variables and also tend to support the use of the time-fixed effects. Therefore, the different indices seeming to favor the use of these effects, we used as hypothesis that time-fixed effects contribute to a better specification of the model.

```{r}
f_eff_time_2<-plm(entrées~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina + factor(year), data=Econ_data_v2, index=c("departement_code", "year"), model="within")
plmtest(f_eff_time_2, effect="time", type="bp")
plmtest(f_eff_time_2, effect="time", type="honda")

```

The Lagrange multiplier test support the simultaneous utilization of individual effects.

```{r}
f_eff_ind_2<-plm(entrées~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina + factor(departement_code), data=Econ_data_v2, index=c("departement_code", "year"), model="within")
plmtest(f_eff_time_2, effect="individual", type="bp")
plmtest(f_eff_time_2, effect="individual", type="honda")
```

We then used a two-way model combining time-fixed and individual effects.

```{r}
f_eff_2ways_2 <- plm(entrées~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina + factor(year) + factor(departement_code), data=Econ_data_v2, index=c("departement_code", "year"), model="within")
```

As we said before, it can be noted that while it gave us different coefficients, the utilization of the **effect** argument arrived at the same conclusion regarding the use of a two-way model :

*Test for time-fixed effect*

```{r}
#Model with time-fixed effects.
f_eff_time_2_2<-plm(entrées~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina, data=Econ_data_v2, index=c("departement_code", "year"), model="within", effect = "time")

#PLM test
plmtest(f_eff_time_2_2, effect="time", type="bp")
plmtest(f_eff_time_2_2, effect="time", type="honda")

```

*Test for individual effect*

```{r}
#Model with individual effects
f_eff_ind_2_2<-plm(entrées~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina, data=Econ_data_v2, index=c("departement_code", "year"), model="within", effect = "individual")

# PLM test
plmtest(f_eff_ind_2_2, effect="individual", type="bp")
plmtest(f_eff_time_2_2, effect="individual", type="honda")
```

#### Test for unit roots

By running an augmented Dickey-Fuller test on the attendance, it appears that the explanatory variable seems to bee stationary.

```{r Test_for_unit_roots}
Panel.set<- pdata.frame(Econ_data_v2, index = c("departement_code", "year")) 

adf.test(Econ_data_v2$entrées, k=2)adf.test(Econ_data_v2$entrées, k=2)
```

#### Test for serial correlation

Our model also suffer from serial correlation. Indeed, Breusch-Godfrey/Wooldridge test has a p-value below the significance level. Both, Altaf and Torres-Reyna propose the same method to address cross-sectional dependence the use of Arellano's technique as we will see in the next paragraph.

```{r Test_for_serial_correlation}
pbgtest(f_eff_2ways_2)
```

#### Test of Heterosedasticity

With a p-value below 0.05, our model encounter heteroscedasticity.

```{r #Test_for_heteroscedasticity}
bptest(entrées~ Farm + Craf_sh_head + Ex_intel + Int_prof + Employees + Workers + Retirees + Ina, data = Econ_data_v2, studentize=F)
```

Nevertheless, the use of the **vcovHC** function from the **sandwich** package computes heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance estimators using White and Arellano method (White 1980, 1984; Arellano 1987). Moreover, this function can be used to correct simultaneously both heteroskedasticity and serial correlation with the code ' **method = "arellano"** '.

#### Test for cross-sectional dependence

A final issue is common with panel data, and ours is no exception. This issue is the cross-sectional dependance. As we can see on the Breusch-Pagan and Pesaran tests below, our model suffers of this issue. The utilisation of Beck and Katz method is proposed by Altaf as a solution to tackle this issue. To use this method, we will forego the utilisation of the **vcovHC** function but do a similar work with the **vcovBK** one, which also tackles cross-sectional dependence

```{r Test_for_cross_sectional_dependence}
#Breusch-Pagan LM test for cross-sectional dependence
pcdtest(f_eff_2, test = c("lm"))

#Pesaran test for cross-sectional dependence
pcdtest(f_eff_2, test = c("cd"))
```

### Outcome

```{r Coefficient_with_correction_of_the_different_issues}
coeftest(f_eff_2ways_2, vcov = vcovBK(f_eff_2ways_2, method = "arellano", cluster = "group"))
```

### Bayesan Information Criterion
The selection of the final were performed using the Bayesian Information Criterion.
$$
BIC = N \times T \times \log(\sigma^2) + K \times \log(N \times T) 
$$
With $ \sigma = \frac{SSR}{N \times T}$

<br> 

```{r BIC_Calculation}
ssr <- sum(residuals(f_eff_2ways_2)^2)
sigma_squared <- ssr / (length(residuals(f_eff_2ways_2)))

# Compute BIC manually
n_obs <- length(residuals(f_eff_2ways_2))
k_parameters <- length(coef(f_eff_2ways_2))
bic_value <- n_obs * log(sigma_squared) + k_parameters * log(n_obs)

# Print the BIC value
print(bic_value)
```
